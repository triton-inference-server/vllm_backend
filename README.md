**LATEST RELEASE: You are currently on the main branch which tracks
under-development progress towards the next release. The current release branch
is [r23.12](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/vllm_backend/tree/r23.12)
and which corresponds to the 23.12 container release on
[NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC)](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/tritonserver).**

# vLLM Backend

The Triton backend for [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)
is designed to run
[supported models](https://vllm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models/supported_models.html)
on a
[vLLM engine](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/main/vllm/engine/async_llm_engine.py).
You can learn more about Triton backends in the [backend
repo](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/backend).


This is a [Python-based backend](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/backend/blob/main/docs/python_based_backends.md#python-based-backends).
When using this backend, all requests are placed on the
vLLM AsyncEngine as soon as they are received. Inflight batching and paged attention is handled
by the vLLM engine.

Where can I ask general questions about Triton and Triton backends?
Be sure to read all the information below as well as the [general
Triton documentation](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server#triton-inference-server)
available in the main [server](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server)
repo. If you don't find your answer there you can ask questions on the
main Triton [issues page](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/issues).

## Installing the vLLM Backend

There are several ways to install and deploy the vLLM backend.

### Option 1. Use the Pre-Built Docker Container.

Pull a `tritonserver:<xx.yy>-vllm-python-py3` container with vLLM backend from the
[NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/tritonserver)
registry. \<xx.yy\> is the version of Triton that you want to use. Please note,
that Triton's vLLM container has been introduced starting from 23.10 release.

```
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:<xx.yy>-vllm-python-py3
```

### Option 2. Build a Custom Container From Source
You can follow steps described in the
[Building With Docker](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/docs/customization_guide/build.md#building-with-docker)
guide and use the
[build.py](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/build.py)
script.

A sample command to build a Triton Server container with all options enabled is shown below. Feel free to customize flags according to your needs.

```
./build.py -v  --enable-logging
                --enable-stats
                --enable-tracing
                --enable-metrics
                --enable-gpu-metrics
                --enable-cpu-metrics
                --enable-gpu
                --filesystem=gcs
                --filesystem=s3
                --filesystem=azure_storage
                --endpoint=http
                --endpoint=grpc
                --endpoint=sagemaker
                --endpoint=vertex-ai
                --upstream-container-version=23.12
                --backend=python:r23.12
                --backend=vllm:r23.12
```

### Option 3. Add the vLLM Backend to the Default Triton Container

You can install the vLLM backend directly into the NGC Triton container.
In this case, please install vLLM first. You can do so by running
`pip install vllm==<vLLM_version>`. Then, set up the vLLM backend in the
container with the following commands:

```
mkdir -p /opt/tritonserver/backends/vllm
wget -P /opt/tritonserver/backends/vllm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/triton-inference-server/vllm_backend/main/src/model.py
```

## Using the vLLM Backend

You can see an example
[model_repository](samples/model_repository)
in the [samples](samples) folder.
You can use this as is and change the model by changing the `model` value in `model.json`.
`model.json` represents a key-value dictionary that is fed to vLLM's AsyncLLMEngine when initializing the model.
You can see supported arguments in vLLM's
[arg_utils.py](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/main/vllm/engine/arg_utils.py).
Specifically,
[here](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/ee8217e5bee5860469204ee57077a91138c9af02/vllm/engine/arg_utils.py#L11)
and
[here](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/ee8217e5bee5860469204ee57077a91138c9af02/vllm/engine/arg_utils.py#L201).

For multi-GPU support, EngineArgs like tensor_parallel_size can be specified in
[model.json](samples/model_repository/vllm_model/1/model.json).

Note: vLLM greedily consume up to 90% of the GPU's memory under default settings.
The sample model updates this behavior by setting gpu_memory_utilization to 50%.
You can tweak this behavior using fields like gpu_memory_utilization and other settings in
[model.json](samples/model_repository/vllm_model/1/model.json).

### Launching Triton Inference Server

Once you have the model repository set up, it is time to launch the Triton server.
We will use the [pre-built Triton container with vLLM backend](#option-1-use-the-pre-built-docker-container) from
[NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/tritonserver) in this example.

```
docker run --gpus all -it --net=host --rm -p 8001:8001 --shm-size=1G --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 -v ${PWD}:/work -w /work nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:<xx.yy>-vllm-python-py3 tritonserver --model-repository ./model_repository
```

Replace \<xx.yy\> with the version of Triton that you want to use.
Note that Triton's vLLM container was first published starting from
23.10 release.

After you start Triton you will see output on the console showing
the server starting up and loading the model. When you see output
like the following, Triton is ready to accept inference requests.

```
I1030 22:33:28.291908 1 grpc_server.cc:2513] Started GRPCInferenceService at 0.0.0.0:8001
I1030 22:33:28.292879 1 http_server.cc:4497] Started HTTPService at 0.0.0.0:8000
I1030 22:33:28.335154 1 http_server.cc:270] Started Metrics Service at 0.0.0.0:8002
```

### Sending Your First Inference

After you
[start Triton](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/user-guide/docs/getting_started/quickstart.html)
with the
[sample model_repository](samples/model_repository),
you can quickly run your first inference request with the
[generate endpoint](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/docs/protocol/extension_generate.md).

Try out the command below.

```
$ curl -X POST localhost:8000/v2/models/vllm_model/generate -d '{"text_input": "What is Triton Inference Server?", "parameters": {"stream": false, "temperature": 0}}'
```

Upon success, you should see a response from the server like this one:
```
{"model_name":"vllm_model","model_version":"1","text_output":"What is Triton Inference Server?\n\nTriton Inference Server is a server that is used by many"}
```

In the [samples](samples) folder, you can also find a sample client,
[client.py](samples/client.py) which uses Triton's
[asyncio gRPC client library](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client#python-asyncio-support-beta-1)
to run inference on Triton.

### Running the Latest vLLM Version

You can check the vLLM version included in Triton Inference Server from
[Framework Containers Support Matrix](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/support-matrix/index.html).
*Note:* The vLLM Triton Inference Server container has been introduced
starting from 23.10 release.

You can use  `pip install ...` within the container to upgrade vLLM version.


## Running Multiple Instances of Triton Server

If you are running multiple instances of Triton server with a Python-based backend,
you need to specify a different `shm-region-prefix-name` for each server. See
[here](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/python_backend#running-multiple-instances-of-triton-server)
for more information.
