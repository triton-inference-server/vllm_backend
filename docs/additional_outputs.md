# Additional Outputs from vLLM

The vLLM backend supports sending additional outputs from vLLM on top of the
usual `text_output` when requested.

All additional outputs are disabled by default and they need to be enabled on a
per-request basis. If enabled, the corresponding output tensor will be set for
all responses from the request.

## Supported Additional Outputs

### Finish Reason

The reason why the sequence is finished. See
[here](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/v0.6.3.post1/vllm/outputs.py#L26)
for more details.

To enable, set `return_finish_reason` input tensor to `True`. The reason will be
sent as a string on the `finish_reason` output tensor.

Supported since r24.12.

### Cumulative Log Probabilities

The cumulative log probability of the generated output text. See
[here](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/v0.6.3.post1/vllm/outputs.py#L22)
for more details.

To enable, set `return_cumulative_logprob` input tensor to `True`. The floating
point value will be sent on the `cumulative_logprob` output tensor.

Supported since r24.12.

### Number of Output Tokens

The number of token IDs of the generated output text sent on this response. It
is the difference in length of the token IDs generated from the last response to
this response. If this is the first response, the last response length is
presumed to be zero. See
[here](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/v0.6.3.post1/vllm/outputs.py#L21)
for more details on the token IDs of the generated output text.

To enable, set `return_num_output_tokens` input tensor to `True`. The unsigned
integer value will be sent on the `num_output_tokens` output tensor.

Supported since r24.12.

## Examples

### Add Finish Reason to Outputs

```python
import numpy as np
import tritonclient.grpc as grpcclient

inputs = []

inputs.append(grpcclient.InferInput("text_input", [1], "BYTES"))
inputs[-1].set_data_from_numpy(
    np.array(["example prompt".encode("utf-8")], dtype=np.object_)
)

inputs.append(grpcclient.InferInput("return_finish_reason", [1], "BOOL"))
inputs[-1].set_data_from_numpy(np.array([True], dtype=bool))

def callback(result, error):
    ...
    print(result.as_numpy(name="finish_reason"))

with grpcclient.InferenceServerClient("localhost:8001") as client:
    client.start_stream(callback)
    client.async_stream_infer("vLLM_model_name", inputs=inputs, ...)
    client.stop_stream()
```

## Notes

* Enabling additional outputs may impact performance, only add additional
outputs when necessary.
